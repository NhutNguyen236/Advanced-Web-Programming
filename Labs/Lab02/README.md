## Start a new project in Node

```
npm init -y
```

## Exercise 01 note
- Challenge here is everything will be placed in `main.js` so there will be no `.html` or else
- To actually do this, I will have to create a `html` file outside the main first and name it `calculator.html` then copy it to the `main.js` later so things will get easier for me

### Some sort of debugging :bug:

```
node --inspect main.js
```
