# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to `LAB04` ðŸŽ‰

## Aims 

- Here, we are about to deal with sort of "product infor management"

- You will be able to:
  
  - Form control
  - Add product
  - Delete product
  - View product

## Setting up project and things around it
- Firstly, you don't need to create a new project ðŸ˜†, just keep going cause we will keep up the good job from `Lab03`

- For project setup, you can visit `Lab03` for more

## Tips ðŸ˜†
- Highly recommend using Chrome developer debugger cause of the nice and neat interface which is of course, better than VS Code console. Firstly, open Chrome and search for this `chrome://inspect/#devices`

- Then click `Open dedicated DevTools for Node` to attach it to a running VS Code inspection 

- To test image upload section, you should find a 500KB image on the internet or increase that `fileSize` from the code
