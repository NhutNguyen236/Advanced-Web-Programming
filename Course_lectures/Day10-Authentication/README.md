# WELCOME TO `DAY 10 - AUTHENTICATION`

- Visit [Google OAuth2 Authentication in NodeJS](loginradius.com/blog/async/google-authentication-with-nodejs-and-passportjs/) if you are too lazy üòõ to read the whole thing here. To be honest, this writing is such trash so I gotta go straight here. Codes copying will not make you write better codes in JS so try to come up with something else more original, no criticism here but writing like this, MUST BE disapproved, I know it is hard to write something to make others understand your points but an act like this will make the situation worse, okie... talk time is over ‚è≤Ô∏è, let's move on

## Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: You gotta need to play around with that Google API Console
- You can move this to the bottom but hold on, move from that small step first, get yourself a good set up will chill you out in the coding phase
