- Everything seems to be executed by `.js` files

## Things around Day01

## Build a Node project 
:one: Open terminal in your selected folder

:two: Use this command to 

```
npm init -y
```

then you will see a `package.json` has been created for you here with the contents of
```
{
  "name": "first_node",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

:three: Create a file named `index.js` because it is listed there in the `package.json`
